# CURSED STRUCT TOKEN

> pls dont use

This token contains a struct. But not just any struct. The unholiest of structs. This struct
contains all internal functions of an ERC20 contract.

Tests were just straight up copy-pasta'd from
[t11s' Solmate](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate) (shout out btw) because there's not a
chance in hell I write tests for this suffering abomination myself. We thank you for your
contribution.
